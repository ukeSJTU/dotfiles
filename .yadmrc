# .yadmrc - Yadm configuration file
# This file configures yadm's behavior

# Auto-process alternates after any yadm command that affects files
# This ensures platform-specific files are always up-to-date
# (This is usually automatic, but we make it explicit here)

# Note: yadm processes alternates automatically on:
# - yadm clone
# - yadm pull
# - yadm checkout
# - yadm reset
# - yadm merge

# The yadm configuration is typically stored in ~/.config/yadm/config
# and managed via: yadm config <key> <value>
# This .yadmrc file is for documentation and can contain comments

# Recommended yadm configuration commands to run:
# yadm config local.class personal  # Set machine class (optional)
# yadm gitconfig core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore_global
